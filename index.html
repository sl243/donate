            <p class="donateParagraph">5 Basic Needs to Survive and Thrive. In extreme conditions, a human can survive
                three minutes without
                air, three hours without shelter, three days without water, and three weeks without food.Your body has
                certain physiological needs that are required for survival. While there are other factors that
                contribute to health and wellness, at its core, your body needs five key elements.Our bodies are
                incredible machines that are capable of much more than we give them credit for. But just like any
                machine, there is maintenance involved in keeping it performing at its best.</p>

                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>Surprisingly, the body can survive quite a while without food. This is mostly attributable to the
                    manner in which your body adjusts metabolism and energy consumption. It is difficult to predict
                    exactly how long a body can survive without this kind of sustenance, however, most estimates range
                    from thirty to forty days.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>A shelter and appropriate clothing are a means of protecting your body and keeping it at a consistent
                    temperature. The biggest concern with being exposed to the elements is water loss. Cold temperatures
                    and wind can strip away valuable moisture just as quickly as high temperatures can cause
                    sweat-related loss.</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>A child’s education starts at home. Parents are thefirst teachers of the child; they also mould the
                    child’s character. A good balance of education at school and home facilitates better learning.
                    Parents have to inspire their children and have to travel with them in their educational journey</p>
